State of the art cross-platform automated unit testing for WordPress plugins, on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS, from the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/buddypress-media/">BP-Media Team</a>.

== Description ==

Razor is a sophisticated cross-platform unit test framework that verifies the PHP and JavaScript code used in WordPress plugins works properly. 

To learn how to use Razor, please visit our <a href="https://code.google.com/p/wp-razor/">Developer Support Site</a>

<h4>It Just Works</h4>
Razor works on <u>any</u> modern desktop operating system with <u>zero</u> user intervention. Our battle-hardened core runs reliably on even the most misconfigured of servers, automatically handling common problems. In the rare cases where Razor can't run, it provides useful debugging info.

<h4>Multi Platform</h4>
Razor runs on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS, letting you seamlessly move from your Windows desktop to your Mac notebook to your Linux production server, confident that your unit tests will run correctly. Razor's multi-platform support dramatically simplifies coordinating large development teams, because everyone on the team can use the same test platform and the same unit tests.

<h4>Zero Dependencies</h4>
Razor's specially modified forks of PHPUnit and JSUnit that don't use PEAR, eliminating PHPUnit's legendary installation problems for Mac and Windows users. Zero dependencies also means you can confidently check Razor into your team's version control system, knowing it will run on any machine.

<h4>Scalable</h4>
Razor meets the needs of both single developers and large development teams. Casual users can run tests in the WordPress backend, viewing results in their browser. Enterprise users can run tests in the terminal window, and can also use Razor as part of large-scale distributed test systems like <a href="http://travis-ci.org/">Travis-CI</a>.

<h4>Extremely Powerful</h4>
