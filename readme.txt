State of the art cross-platform automated unit testing for WordPress plugins, on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS.

== Description ==

Razor is a sophisticated cross-platform unit test framework that verifies the PHP and JavaScript code used in WordPress plugins works properly.

<h4>It Just Works</h4>
Razor works on any modern version of Linux, Windows, or Mac OS with zero configuration changes. You can effortlesly move from your Windows desktop to your Mac notebook to your Linux production server and be confident that your unit tests will run correctly. This also dramatically simplifies coordinating large development teams, because everyone on the team can use the same test platform and the same unit tests.

<h4>No Dependencies</h4>
Razor contains specially modified forks of the PHPUnit and JSUnit libraries that eliminate PEAR dependencies, allowing Razor to spin-up instantly on practically ANY host with no user intervention. This eliminates PHPUnit's legendary installation problems for Mac and Windows users. It also means you can confidently check Razor into your team's version control system, knowing it won't be broken by local dependencies.

<h4>Scalable</h4>
